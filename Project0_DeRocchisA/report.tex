\begin{abstract}

In this report I explore the creation and visualization of randomly generated synthetic data sets. These data sets are to be used in subsequent projects for test and evaluation of algorithm performance. In addition to the randomly generated data sets, I also visualize some predefined data sets by loading the relevant data from files and plotting.

\section{Introduction}

This document is an example of a project report. The document shall be formatted in accordance with the IEEE Transactions journals templates. Each report will consist of an introduction, a section (or subsection) for each problem part, a conclusion, and references. Each figure will be numbered with a caption, well-labeled (axes, color, symbols, etc.), and shall be called out at least once in the report text. I will attempt to be as concise as possible, whilst still fully addressing all problem parts.

\section{Problem 1: Circular Symmetric Gaussian}

A function named "circGauss" was written which returns $N$ samples drawn from a circular symmetric multi-variate Gaussian distribution of dimension $D$ with variance $\sigma^2$

\begin{align}
	X \thicksim
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\mathcal{N}($\mu_1$, $\sigma^2$) \\
		\mathcal{N}($\mu_2$, $\sigma^2$) \\
		\vdots \\
		\mathcal{N}($\mu_D$, $\sigma^2$)
        \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

where $\mu_k$ is the mean for the $k$th dimension \cite{b1}. The function was used to generate a data set (shown in figure \ref{fig:circgauss}) consisting of samples drawn from two circular symmetric multi-variate Gaussian distributions in two dimensions with one distribution at the origin and one at the point $(5, 5)$, where both distributions have $\sigma^2 = 3$.

\section{Problem 2: Double Moon Data Set}
A function named "doublemoon" was written which returns $N$ samples drawn from a double moon distribution \cite{b2}. Figure \ref{fig:doublemoon} shows an example of data drawn from the double moon distribution with parameters $N=500$ samples, $d=0$, $r=1$, and $w=0.6$. In figure \ref{fig2} the members of class $\mathscr{C}_1$ are plotted as "blue +" and $\mathscr{C}_2$ are plotted as "green x".

\section{Problem 3: Concentric Gaussian Data Set}
A function named "concentGauss" was written which returns $N$ samples drawn from a data set consisting of a circular symmetric Gaussian centered at the origin with variance $\sigma^2_{center}$ and a Gaussian annulus centered at the origin with radius mean $r$ and variance $\sigma^2_{outer}$. Figure \ref{fig:concentgauss} shows an example of data drawn from the concentric Gaussian data set with $N=500$ samples, $\sigma^2_{center}=1$, $r=5$, and $\sigma^2_{outer}=1$ with members of class $\mathscr{C}_1$ plotted as "blue +" and class $\mathscr{C}_2$ plotted as "green x". 

\section{Problem 4: Gaussian XOR Data Set}
A function named "gaussX" was written which returns $N$ samples drawn from a Gaussian XOR distribution. Figure \ref{fig:gaussx} shows an example of data drawn from a Gaussian XOR data set with $N=500$ samples and $\sigma^2=1$, where members of class $\mathscr{C}_1$ are plotted as "blue +" and members of $\mathscr{C}_2$ as "green x".

\section{Problem 5: Noisy Sinusoidal Data Set}
\subsection{Randomly Generated}\label{section:randomgen}
A function named "noisySin" was written which returns $N$ samples drawn from a noisy sine distribution with a sinusoidal amplitude of $1$ and period $2\pi$, where the added noise has a variance $\sigma^2$. Figure \ref{fig:noisysingen} shows an example of data drawn from a noisy sine data set with $N=50$ samples and $\sigma^2=0.05$, where the noise-added sinusoidal data is plotted as "blue o" and the clean sinusoidal waveform is plotted as a green curve.

\subsection{Loading from File}
To demonstrate the instance of needing to use a pre-existing, given, data set, the file "curvefitting.txt" was loaded. The data set consists of input $x$ and target $t$ values. This set was plotted, as shown in figure \ref{fig:noisysinfile}, using the same method as section \ref{section:randomgen}, with the noise-added sinusoidal data plotted as "blue o", and the clean sinusoid plotted as a green curve.

\section{Problem 6: Old Faithful Data Set}
The Old Faithful data set was loaded from the file "faithful.txt" and plotted. The results are shown in figure \ref{fig:oldfaithful}.

\section{Problem 7: Neural Spike Data Set}
The Neural Spike data set was loaded from the file "spikes.csv" and plotted. The results are shown in figure \ref{fig:neuralspikes}.

\section{Conclusion}
In this project I loaded, generated, and visualized several data sets which will be useful for test and evaluation of machine learning algorithms. In addition, this document serves as a simple example of what is expected in a project write-up.
